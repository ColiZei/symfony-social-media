# Simple Symfony Social Media Server

... for practicing Symfony and Symfony Api Platform

This Repo should contain the same features as the [NestJS Version](https://github.com/ColiZei/nestjs-social-media)

## Why two repositorys?

I'd would like to imporove my Symfony and NestJS skills.  
You too? Feel free to join!  

VueJs Client will be added soon in a seperate repository.
